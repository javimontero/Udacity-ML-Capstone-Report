# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project 
## Algorithmic trading using Deep-Q Reinforcement Learning methods

This is the final graduation capstone project were I explain the approach to develop a Reinforcement Learning agent designed to learn to trade Bitcoin.

Find also the link to the [companion repository](https://github.com/javimontero/deep-q-trader) that contains the code for the deep-q trading agent.
